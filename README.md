# Global_VideoGamess_Sales

## Introduction
The video game industry has experienced exponential growth in recent years, driven by advancements in technology, a growing global population, and a constantly evolving gaming landscape. For developers, publishers, and investors, accurately predicting video game sales has become a critical task, with billions of dollars at stake. Leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques offers a promising approach to more accurately forecast sales data. This project delves into the methodologies, datasets, and insights derived from predictive models, demonstrating the application of AI/ML algorithms in predicting video game sales. By utilizing these advanced techniques, stakeholders in the competitive and dynamic video game industry can enhance profitability, optimize marketing strategies, and make well-informed decisions.

## Objectives
Develop Predictive Models: Create machine learning models to accurately predict video game sales using historical and contextual data.
Support Decision Making: Provide insights that help stakeholders optimize marketing tactics and investment strategies.
Analyze Influencing Factors: Identify and understand the impact of various factors on video game sales, such as genre, platform, release date, and developer/publisher.
Methodology
Data Collection: Collect historical sales data and related attributes, including game titles, platforms, release dates, genres, developers, publishers, and sales figures across different regions.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand data distributions, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between different attributes and sales figures.
Feature Engineering: Create new features and select the most relevant ones to improve model performance.
Model Development: Apply various machine learning algorithms, including regression techniques and ensemble methods, to build models that predict video game sales.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess their accuracy and robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters to enhance performance.
Model Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model for practical use, providing a user-friendly interface for stakeholders.
Results
The developed models demonstrated the ability to accurately predict video game sales based on historical and contextual data. The insights obtained can help stakeholders in the video game industry refine their marketing strategies, optimize investment decisions, and enhance overall profitability.
